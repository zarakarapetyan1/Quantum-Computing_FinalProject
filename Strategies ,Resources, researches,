First, I watched videos about the game and how to play it to improve my imagination and 
gain insight into Mastermind. Here are the links I watched.

Actually, I find the game very interesting and I would like to play it in real life :)

Also, while going through the videos, I came across a video where were told how to win the game MasterMind, 
and I decided to watch it to get some ideas to apply to Quantum Computing topics. 
Below is the link of video.

I have separated some key strategies I may apply in my project by watching the video.
1) One of the strategies is to take two colors each twice(for 4 bits), 
and by keeping the last two numbers the same,
it changes the two front numbers to find some pattern; for example, in our case, 
if I first try 1100, then by keeping 00 the same, try 1000, or 0100 to find some pattern, 
But that will not work well for our problem of finding the shortest solution. Still, we can try it and be sure whether it will work. 

2) The second strategy I watched is similar to the first one; it puts the
last three colors(in our case, digits) the same and tries like that,
for example, 1000 or 0111. I need to try this, too, but I do not think it will work. 

Then, I decided to play this game online; the link is below. 
It was pretty satisfying, though it hits differently when you play with different colors. 
Still, it can help us practice our mind to achieve the optimized solution.

I also tried some strategies discussed during the lecture and PSS and included them in the strategy file.
