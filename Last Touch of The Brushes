2. Estimate the complexity of the move search in different stages of the game.
So, we have discussed this already during our final project last discussion. But I would like to write it, discuss it here first of all for me, to understand it better and better. 



3. Suggest a system of qubits that describes the game, and define the game states and state
vectors.
4. Design quantum gates that implement the operations of the sequential classical algorithm.
5. Apply the designed gates to superposition states aiming at parallelization of the move
search.
